                <p>A symbol of ancient Roman power and engineering.It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built,
                    and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began

                    mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. </p>

                <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
                <p>A marvel of ancient Chinese architecture, stretching thousands of miles.Several walls were built from
                    as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC),
                    the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties
                    built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
                    built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
                <p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
                    imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
                    and the control of immigration and emigration.</p>

                <h2>Taj Mahal, India</h2>
                <p>A stunning white marble mausoleum, a symbol of love.t was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal
                    emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also
                    houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
                    complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
                    sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
                <p>Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the
                    project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
                    Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal
                    complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time
                    to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).</p>
